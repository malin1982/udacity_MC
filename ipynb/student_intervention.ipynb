    "## Training and Evaluating Models\n",
    "In this section, you will choose 3 supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem and available in `scikit-learn`. You will first discuss the reasoning behind choosing these three models by considering what you know about the data and each model's strengths and weaknesses. You will then fit the model to varying sizes of training data (100 data points, 200 data points, and 300 data points) and measure the F<sub>1</sub> score. You will need to produce three tables (one for each model) that shows the training set size, training time, prediction time, F<sub>1</sub> score on the training set, and F<sub>1</sub> score on the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following supervised learning models are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**\n",
    "- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC)\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive Bayes\n",
    "Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods. The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution. This in turn helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "On the flip side, although naive Bayes is known as a decent classifier, it is known to be a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from predict_proba are not to be taken too seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Some advantages of decision trees are:\n",
    "- Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "- Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n",
    "- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "- Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for more information.\n",
    "- Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "- Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "- Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "- The disadvantages of decision trees include:\n",
    "- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "- The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "- There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble\n",
    "The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability / robustness over a single estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- bagging meta methods:\n",
    "In many cases, bagging methods constitute a very simple way to improve with respect to a single model, without making it necessary to adapt the underlying base algorithm. As they provide a way to reduce overfitting, bagging methods work best with strong and complex models (e.g., fully developed decision trees), in contrast with boosting methods which usually work best with weak models (e.g., shallow decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "Supervised neighbors-based learning comes in two flavors: classification for data with discrete labels, and regression for data with continuous labels.Neighbors-based methods are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods, since they simply “remember” all of its training data. Despite its simplicity, nearest neighbors has been successful in a large number of classification and regression problems, including handwritten digits or satellite image scenes. Being a non-parametric method, it is often successful in classification situations where the decision boundary is very irregular.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC)\n",
    "SGD has been successfully applied to large-scale and sparse machine learning problems often encountered in text classification and natural language processing. Given that the data is sparse, the classifiers in this module easily scale to problems with more than 10^5 training examples and more than 10^5 features.\n",
    "- The advantages of Stochastic Gradient Descent are:\n",
    "Efficiency.\n",
    "Ease of implementation (lots of opportunities for code tuning).\n",
    "- The disadvantages of Stochastic Gradient Descent include:\n",
    "SGD requires a number of hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter and the number of iterations.\n",
    "SGD is sensitive to feature scaling.\n",
    "The major advantage of SGD is its efficiency, which is basically linear in the number of training examples. If X is a matrix of size (n, p) training has a cost of O(k n \\bar p), where k is the number of iterations (epochs) and \\bar p is the average number of non-zero attributes per sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM\n",
    "Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The advantages of support vector machines are:\n",
    "Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The disadvantages of support vector machines include:\n",
    "If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic regression, despite its name, is a linear model for classification rather than regression. Logistic regression is also known in the literature as logit regression, maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt) or the log-linear classifier. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function.\n",

    "Bayesian learning neural network is implemented for credit card fraud detection, telecommunications fraud, auto claim fraud detection, and medical insurance fraud(wikipedia)\n",
    "Some important studies with unsupervised learning with respect to fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand[11] use Peer Group Analysis and Break Point Analysis applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand[11] develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.(wikipedia)\n",
